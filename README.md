# What is Wrapper: Shop?
Wrapper: Shop is the #1 method for getting all things Wrapper. It includes tons of Wrapper mods in one easy to navigate website.

## Can I make my own version of it?
Yes! It's easy!

### But how?
just use heroku or something idk

# Why does Wrapper: Shop exist?
It's designed to be an easy method of getting Wrapper or Wrapper mods.

## Why isn't it just the GA Wrapper assets but with a bunch of mods inside?
That already exists, and what about Wrapper: Offline? (or any other LVM with access to the server/store folder) It would also be limited, as you can't download any video list themes and you're only restricted to what's there.

## But why not just fork it?
didn't think of that who cares
